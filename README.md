# FPU-Extended-Calculator
Double Extended precision FPU calculator (80 bits).

Initial DELPHI project modified with FPU ASM code to get the same precision in data presentation than in the data calculation.

Usually modern Windows platforms works inside with double extended precision (80 bits) but for data presentation limits them to doubled precision only (64 bits). 

Take a look the new repository: Extended-precision-in-Delphi for changes in the new code.
