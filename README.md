# FPU-Extended-Calculator

Double Extended precision FPU calculator (80 bits).

Usually modern Windows platforms works inside with double extended precision (80 bits) but for data presentation limits them to doubled precision (only 64 bits).

DELPHI project modified with FPU ASM code to get the same precision in data presentation than in data calculation.

Take a look the new repository: Extended-precision-in-Delphi for changes in the new code.

In the file CodeChanges.txt new code can be checked. Aplication: ExtendedPrecisionFPUdemo29.exe added to see new FPU coded working! 

Use the file FPUExtendedCalculator91.exe to patch your calculator!

If you only want an executable file already patched this is the one: PATCHFPUExtendedCalculator91.exe

Use the Help button into the programs to know how they work and how to use them!
