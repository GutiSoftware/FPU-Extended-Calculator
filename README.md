# FPU-Extended-Calculator

Double Extended precision FPU calculator (80 bits).

Usually modern Windows platforms works inside with double extended precision (80 bits) but for data presentation limits them to doubled precision only (64 bits).

DELPHI project modified with FPU ASM code to get the same precision in data presentation than in data calculation.

Take a look the new repository: Extended-precision-in-Delphi for changes in the new code.

In the file CodeChanges.txt new code can be checked.
