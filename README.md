# FPU-Extended-Calculator
Double Extended precision FPU calculator (80 bits).

Initial DELPHI project modified with FPU ASM code to get the same precision in data presentation than in the data calculation.

Usually modern Windows platforms works inside with double extended precision (80 bits) but for data presentation limits them to doubled precision only (64 bits). 

Read the file ChangesToDELPHIcode.txt to see the changes made in de initial DELPHI executable code.

if you only want te executable file this is the one: CalPFUEnglishUHR11.exe
