# FPU-Extended-Calculator
Double Extended precision FPU calculator (80 bits).

Initial DELPHI project modified with FPU ASM code to get the same precision in data presentation than in the data calculation.

Usually modern Windows platforms works inside with double extended precision (80 bits) but for data presentation limits them to doubled precision only (64 bits). 

Take a look the new repository: Extended-precision-in-Delphi for changes in the new code.

If you only want the last executable file with maximun amount of significant digits this is the one: FPUCalculator64.exe

The file PatchFPUCalculator10.exe patch any new caculator compiled with the Delphi project (Folder: DelphiProjectCalculator)

There is a Folder also with the delphi project for de Patccher 

Use the Help button into the exe files to konow how they work and how to use tehm!
